# AI-IDS Dashboard

## Overview

The AI-IDS Dashboard is a web-based interface for monitoring and analyzing network traffic using an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It integrates with a FastAPI backend that runs AI models trained on the CIC-IDS and UNSW-NB15 datasets, providing real-time threat detection and logging.

Included within the files are the models training notebooks, along with the datasets the models were trained on, each of the datasets has been compressed into .7Zip files - when running the model training code, the files will need to be uncompressed. One of the files, "Monday-WorkingHours.pcap_ISCX.csv" couldn't be uploaded - even compressed the dataset was too large of a filsize, this dataset file will have to be downloaded from the original source. 

All of the orignial CICIDS files can be found here: http://cicresearch.ca/CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017/ <br/>
All of the orignial UNSW-NB15 files can be found here: https://shorturl.at/m3QUk 


The full list of uploaded files which need to be extracted / uncompressed are:

  Tech Stack


## Backend

  Python (FastAPI, TensorFlow, Scapy, Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
  
  Machine Learning Models (CNN-based AI IDS trained on CIC-IDS & UNSW-NB15 datasets)
  
  SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing logs)


## Frontend

  React (with Vite for optimized performance)
  
  Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  
  Recharts (for data visualization)
  
  Axios (for API requests)



# Installation

### If running the packet sniffer, it will start to pickup packet data from your own network - which will return as benign (as expected)
### However, you may initially receive an error message - this is because the packet sniffer uses npcap to take in data.
### To install npcap go here : https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.81.exe
### Node.js is needed to run npm commands, If Node.js is not already installed then it can be downloaded here: https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

1. Install Backend Dependencies

    cd Code <br/>
    cd backend <br/>
    pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>

2. Install Frontend Dependencies

    cd.. <br/>
    cd frontend/ai-ids-dashboard <br/>
    npm install <br/>
 
3. Run the Backend Server

    cd.. <br/>
    cd.. <br/>
    cd backend <br/>
    python -m uvicorn main:app --reload <br/>

    (Default runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000)<br/>

4. Run the Frontend

    cd.. <br/>
    cd frontend/ai-ids-dashboard<br/>
    npm start<br/>

    (Default runs on http://localhost:3000)<br/>



## Usage

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Monitor incoming network traffic in real-time.

View attack classifications and logs generated by the AI IDS.



## Future Enhancements

Improve real-time packet sniffing using more detailed feature extraction.

Implement authentication for admin users.

Add a database for storing detected intrusions.

Migrate frontend to Vite for better performance.
